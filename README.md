### `Component Hierarchy:`

### `Favorite Function:`
```javascript
componentDidMount() {
       let url = `https://suresell.herokuapp.com/cars/`;
       if (this.state.token) {
           fetch(url, {
               method: 'GET',
               headers: {
                   'Content-Type': 'application/json',
               },
           })
               .then((res) => res.json())
               .then((res) => {
                   this.setState({ features: [...res] });
               });
       }
   }

```
In this code, when the ViewAll component is rendered, token is being checked to see if it is present with an authenticated login. If so run the fetch GET method, then take the response and turn it into a readable json file, then take that response and set the carspecs with that response to be used to make reference cards.


### `Roadmap:`
- User creation
- users accessing their store or teamsâ€™ inventory to manipulate
- ding features to their inventory
